# ROS2 Project

## Purpose
This project aims to provide a robust platform for developing robotics applications using the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2). It facilitates the integration of various robotic components and promotes the development of scalable solutions.

## Technical Stack
- **Language:** Python, C++
- **Frameworks:** ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)
- **Libraries:** rclcpp, rclpy, sensor_msgs, std_msgs, SqLite3

## Features
- Modular architecture for easy component integration
- Support for various robotic sensors and actuators
- Real-time data processing
- Visualization tools
- Extensive testing framework to ensure reliability

## Setup Instructions
1. **Prerequisites**  
   Ensure that you have the following installed:
   - ROS2 (Foxy, Galactic, or Humble)
   - Python 3.6 or higher
   - C++ build tools

2. **Clone the repository**  
   Run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/M-Faisal12/ROS2.git
   cd ROS2
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-rosdep
   rosdep update
   rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
   ```

4. **Build the package**  
   ```bash
   colcon build
   ```

5. **Source the workspace**  
   ```bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

6. **Run the application**  
   ```bash
   ros2 run <package_name> <executable_name>
   ```
